# Google Reporter

Easily integrate Google Analytics into your iOS, macOs, and tvOS app without downloading any of the Google SDKs.

[Read why I created Google Reporter here](https://medium.com/swift-digest/using-google-analytics-in-your-app-without-any-sdks-46f9a70bc178)

## Set Up

Works with Carthage or just put ``GoogleReporter.swift`` into your project. 

From your ``AppDelegate``'s ``didFinishLaunchingWithOptions`` or where you initialize your app. You need to configure the
``GoogleReporter`` with ``UA-XXXXX-XX`` tracker ID.

```swift
import GoogleReporter

@UIApplicationMain
class AppDelegate: UIResponder, UIApplicationDelegate {
    func application(_ application: UIApplication,
                     didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [UIApplicationLaunchOptionsKey: Any]?) -> Bool {
        GoogleReporter.shared.configure(withTrackerId: "UA-XXXXX-XX")

        return true
    }
}
```

## Usage

You can track any event you wish to using the ``event()`` method on the ``GoogleReporter``. Example:

```swift
func didCompleteSignUp() {
    GoogleReporter.shared.event("Authentication", action: "Sign Up Completed")
}
```

In many cases you'll want to track what "screens" that the user navigates to. A natural place to do that is in your ``ViewController``s ``viewDidAppear``.
You can use the ``screenView()`` method of the ``GoogleReporter`` which works the same as ``event()``.

```swift
class BeerViewController: UIViewController {
    override func viewDidAppear(_ animated: Bool) {
        super.viewDidAppear(animated)
	GoogleReporter.shared.screenView("Beer")
    }
}
```

## Technical Notes

The GoogleReporter uses the native ``UserDefaults.standard`` to store a random UUID that uniquely identifies the user/install. Clearing or otherwise tampering
with the UserDefaults may cause the user identifier to be lost and the GoogleReporter will generate a new unique identifier.

The GoogleReporter class is not thread-safe. To avoid bugs, always use the ``GoogleReporter.shared`` accessor from the same thread. I suggest using the main thread.
The network call to log the data will still happen on a background thread.


## Roadmap

We're planning to to add more functionality to easily interact with the Measurement Protocol.
Still to be implemented:

- [ ] Session tracking; start, end, duration.
- [ ] Custom variable tracking for screenviews
